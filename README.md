# DungeonGame
Little dungeon crawling game I made with GameMaker Studio 1.4 inspired by the Mystery Dungeon series.
I made this some time before starting university and before any formal education on software engineering.
The objective of the game is to reach the stairs, defeating enemies along the way.
Currently, the game does not end.

# How to play
Simply download the DungeonTest folder and run the .exe file in it.
Use the X button to close the window/game.

Controls:
- Move your character with arrow keys
- Use SPACE to fire a damaging bolt
- Use SHIFT + arrow keys to turn your character without ending your turn.

# Features
## Level Generation
A level has three types of tiles: FLOOR, WALL, and STAIRS. There is only one STAIRS tile in an entire level, while the rest are either FLOORs or WALLs.
Obviously, FLOORs represent walkable tiles while WALLs represent obstacles.
1. Levels are semi-randomly generated, and every level consists of 16 equally-sized rooms (4x4 grid of rooms), and every room is a 16x16 grid of tiles.
2. Rooms are assigned a layout from a set of predetermined layouts. There are only a few base layouts, but they can be rotated to increase the variety. As a result, a single base layout has 4 variations.
   - The base layouts are encoded in a .txt file to allow for easy adding of new base layouts. The .txt file is parsed when the game is started.
4. After every room has been assigned a layout, inter-room connections are generated by running a modified depth-first search where the next visited room is randomized. This ensures that there is a path between every room while making room connections somewhat random.
5. For every room connection, a path is generated between two randomly chosen FLOOR tiles from both rooms.
6. Lastly, a STAIRS tile is placed in a random FLOOR tile in the level.
